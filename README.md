## Shape Detection project
My shape Detection project  is a Machine learning project to help everyone do  classify the image based on shapes.
	
## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Python version: Python 3.6.

## Machine Learning Term

### SVM:
    A support vector machine is a popular supervised learning model, used for both data classification and regression. That said, it is typically leveraged for classification problems, constructing a hyperplane where the distance between two classes of data points is at its maximum.

#### Advantages: 
    1. SVM works relatively well when there is a clear margin of separation between classes. 
    2. SVM is more effective in high dimensional spaces. 
    3. SVM is effective in cases where the number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples. 
    4. SVM is relatively memory efficient
#### Disadvantages: 
    5. SVM algorithm is not suitable for large data sets. 
    6. SVM does not perform very well when the data set has more noise i.e. target classes are overlapping. 
    7. In cases where the number of features for each data point exceeds the number of training data samples, the SVM will underperform. 
    8. As the support vector classifier works by putting data points, above and below the classifying hyperplane there is no probabilistic explanation for the classification.

### Classification:
    Classification is a technique, where we categorize the data into given classes.
